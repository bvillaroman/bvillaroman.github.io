The Universal Design Compass is tool that allows individuals to record, time, and analyze their 
progress while undergoing a design process.

Understanding your flaws and strengths in where you allocate your time and effort in your design process will allow you to improve the way you plan your future design processes.

With todayâ€™s technology being mainly mobile, we want to allow users to have the universal design compass in the palm of their hands.
